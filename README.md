### **EXCEL: GRADE CALCULATOR**

This project is a custom Excel-based grade calculator for two Loyola classes, featuring weighted grading, automatic letter grade conversion, and a pie chart to visualize assignment impact and help students track academic performance.

![Grade Calculator](potfolio_images\grade_calc.png)

**Initial project idea:**
I came up with the idea for this project based on a real need—tracking my grades throughout the semester to stay on top of my academic progress. I decided to create a grade calculator for two of my classes at Loyola University because it’s essential to know how each assignment, exam, or participation score contributes to my final grade. The problem I wanted to solve was having a personalized, real-time system to monitor and project final grades — something more interactive and specific than what most learning platforms provide.

**Tools I used:**
I used Microsoft Excel to build a grade calculator that included assignment categories, point values, weights (as defined in each course syllabus), and conditional formulas to calculate both number and letter grades. I also created an annotated pie chart to visually show the weight distribution of assignments and identify which components have the biggest impact on the final grade.

**Challenges I faced:**
One challenge was structuring the gradebook so that it was both easy to use and formula-driven. Applying conditional logic to convert number grades into letter grades took some trial and error. I also had to ensure that the weightings added up to 100% and that each formula dynamically adjusted based on input. These were resolved by testing the calculator with sample data and cross-checking results with grading rubrics in my syllabi.

**Other Resources:**
I used my course syllabi to get accurate assignment weights and grading scales. I also referenced Excel tutorials—especially for IF statements, percentage calculations, and chart creation. While I didn’t collaborate with others directly, I reviewed examples of grade calculators online to get formatting ideas.

**Result:**
I set out to build a personalized, flexible grade calculator for two of my classes, and I achieved that goal. The calculator includes live formulas that compute my current grade, predict my final outcome, and display my progress in both number and letter format. The pie chart helps me visually prioritize high-impact assignments. If I were to take this further, I’d add a third class or build a dashboard that compares overall GPA projections.

### **EXCEL: RESALE TICKET BUSINESS**

This Excel project models a resale ticket business, integrating inventory tracking, dynamic pricing via lookup tables, loan payment projections, and affordability logic to simulate real-world decision-making in a small business environment.

![ticket Business](potfolio_images\side_hustle.png)

**Initial project idea:**
I started this project by imagining a realistic side business I could manage and analyze using Excel. I chose to create a resale ticket business because it’s both relatable and dependent on data management—making it a great scenario for applying inventory tracking, pricing, and profit analysis. The problem I set out to solve was how to efficiently organize and analyze key business metrics like pricing, quantity, profit, and affordability—important considerations for any small business owner.

**Tools I used:**
I used Microsoft Excel to build a robust, multi-part workbook. Across the project, I incorporated multi-worksheet functionality, formatted data tables, formulas (including SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, and MAX), absolute and mixed cell referencing, IF statements, conditional formatting, VLOOKUP for pricing data, and PMT functions for loan payments. I also created a Data Analytics worksheet to serve as a dynamic lookup table.

**Challenges I faced:**
The biggest challenges were understanding how to apply more advanced Excel functions like VLOOKUP and PMT, especially while keeping all the data accurate and the layout clean. Calculating total loan costs and comparing them across different loan durations was also tricky at first, as it required correctly formatting and structuring the formulas. I overcame these issues through trial-and-error, using help guides and course materials, and double-checking outputs for accuracy.

**Other Resources:**
I used online tutorials, Excel’s help functions, and the course video content—especially for understanding loan payment formulas, lookup functions, and decision logic. I also referenced class discussions and peer feedback to refine my approach and formatting.

**Result:**
I set out to build a detailed business tool that could manage inventory and analyze pricing, profitability, and affordability—and I succeeded. I now have a fully functioning resale ticket business workbook that includes pricing automation via lookup tables, quantity tracking, total and grand total calculations, monthly loan payment projections across three durations, and affordability checks based on a user-defined budget. If I were to extend the project, I’d include visual dashboards using charts and pivot tables, or even build a simple user interface for non-Excel users.

### **EXCEL: BUDGET TRACKER**

This Excel project is a personal budget tracker that helps monitor income, expenses, and savings goals. It includes formulas and formatting to provide a simple, customized way to manage monthly finances effectively.

![Budget Tracker](potfolio_images\budget_tracker.png)

**Initial project idea:**
I created this budget tracker project to gain better control of my personal finances as a college student. I realized I needed a clearer picture of where my money goes each month—especially with expenses like dining out, subscriptions, and savings goals. The problem I set out to solve was how to consistently track income, spending, and savings in a way that’s personalized, visual, and easy to maintain.

**Tools I used:**
I used Microsoft Excel to build a customized budget tracker. The sheet included categories for biweekly income, current savings, savings goals, and monthly expenses like shopping, dining out, entertainment, insurance, and more. I formatted it using tables, formulas for automatic totals and balances, and color coding to easily see spending trends and savings progress.

**Challenges I faced:**
A challenge was making sure all the categories were comprehensive enough without getting cluttered. It also took time to get the formulas right, especially for calculating remaining balances and tracking progress toward savings goals. I resolved these issues by looking at example templates and tweaking the layout to suit my needs and spending habits.

**Other Resources:**
I referenced the Ramsey Solutions budget tracker example for layout inspiration and used online tutorials to fine-tune formulas. I also reflected on my actual spending and saving patterns to customize the categories meaningfully. Although I didn’t work directly with anyone, I asked a friend to test it for usability.

**Result:**
I successfully created a functional, visually clear budget tracker that helps me manage my monthly finances. It tracks income, expenses, and savings, and includes space for setting financial goals. If I continued this project, I’d add charts to visualize spending by category over time, and maybe a debt tracker if needed.

### **PYTHON: PERSONALITY TEST**

This Python project is a personality quiz that assigns users a dog breed—Golden Retriever, Pug, German Shepherd, or Chihuahua — based on their answers to a 10-question quiz using conditional logic and scoring.

![Budget Tracker](potfolio_images\python_personality_test.png)

**Initial project idea:**
I wanted to create a fun and engaging Python project that could showcase logic, user interaction, and scoring in a creative way. I came up with the idea for a dog breed personality quiz because it's lighthearted but still demonstrates real coding concepts like conditionals, loops, and user input. The problem I aimed to solve was how to make a Python program that feels interactive and personalized, while also using logic to sort users into specific categories based on their answers.

**Tools I used:**
I used Python to develop the application, incorporating loops for user input, if-else logic for scoring, a dictionary or list-based structure to organize the questions and options, and conditional checks for error handling.

**Challenges I faced:**
One challenge was figuring out the best way to structure the scoring system so each answer mapped clearly to a specific dog breed. I needed to make sure that scoring remained accurate and that the program properly handled ties or invalid inputs. I overcame this by carefully planning the answer logic ahead of time in a document, using dictionaries to track scores, and adding input validation so the quiz wouldn’t crash on incorrect entries.

**Other Resources:**
Before coding, I used a Google document to brainstorm 10 questions and matched each multiple-choice answer to one of the four dog breeds: Golden Retriever, Pug, German Shepherd, and Chihuahua. I also referenced class materials on loops and conditionals and tested the project on friends to make sure the experience made sense.

**Result:**
The finished project is a working Python application that asks users 10 questions and uses their answers to determine which dog breed best matches their personality. It includes a scoring system, personality descriptions, and input error handling. If I were to extend it, I’d ask more questions and add more possible breeds to make it more accurate.

![SPSS Data](potfolio_images\SPSS_Intro2.png)

**Initial project idea:**
This project involved analyzing a real-world dataset to uncover statistical relationships — in this case, how temperature and other factors influence cricket chirping rates. I really enjoyed this project because it blended statistical methods with applied research, which directly aligns with my interests as a psychology and statistics major who wants to go into psychological research. The project helped develop my skills in SPSS, a tool commonly used in the field, and allowed me to practice making data-driven conclusions.

**Tools I used:**
I used SPSS to import and analyze the dataset, which included variables like cricket chirps, time of day, and temperature. I revised the variable types and added a new variable — temperature in Fahrenheit — using a transformation formula. I then used SPSS to run descriptive statistics, generate a scatter plot with a line of best fit, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, determine p-values, and make a prediction based on a given temperature.

**Challenges I faced:**
A key challenge was learning how to navigate SPSS efficiently, especially when configuring variable types and labels. I also had to ensure my interpretation of the statistical outputs (like the p-value and correlation) was accurate and clearly connected to the research question. I overcame this by carefully referencing class materials and reinforcing my understanding of correlation and statistical significance from past statistics courses.

**Other Resources:**
I primarily relied on course tutorials and SPSS help documentation. I also revisited some notes from my statistics classes to refresh my understanding of correlation interpretation and prediction models. 

**Result:**
I successfully completed the project and created a PowerPoint presentation that walked through every step — from data setup to statistical interpretation and prediction. I determined that there was a statistically significant correlation between temperature and chirp frequency, and I used the model to predict chirps at 72.5°F. This project gave me a solid foundation for future research involving statistical software, which is crucial for my goal of working with psychological data in the future.
