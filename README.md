### About Me 
Hi! I am a psychology and statistics scholar with over 3 years of proven expertise in child care.

With skills in time management, flexibility, communication, and conflict resolution, I am able to design and implement developmentally appropriate, evidence-based strategies for supporting children’s growth, and achieve measurable improvements in emotional regulation and social skills. I am also adept at using Excel, SPSS, and Python to collect, analyze, and interpret behavioral data in both academic and applied settings.

My comprehensive skill set, commitment to encountering all people with empathy, and passion for accessible and de-stigmatized mental health assistance makes me a valuable asset in both the psychology and child care fields. In my spare time, I like to hike, play soccer, hang out with friends and family, and go to the beach.

#### EXCEL: GRADE CALCULATOR

This project is a custom Excel-based grade calculator for two Loyola classes, featuring weighted grading, automatic letter grade conversion, and a pie chart to visualize assignment impact and help students track academic performance.

**Initial project idea:**
I came up with the idea for this project based on a real need—tracking my grades throughout the semester to stay on top of my academic progress. I decided to create a grade calculator for two of my classes at Loyola University because it’s essential to know how each assignment, exam, or participation score contributes to my final grade. The problem I wanted to solve was having a personalized, real-time system to monitor and project final grades—something more interactive and specific than what most learning platforms provide.

**Tools I used:**
I used Microsoft Excel to build a grade calculator that included assignment categories, point values, weights (as defined in each course syllabus), and conditional formulas to calculate both number and letter grades. I also created an annotated pie chart to visually show the weight distribution of assignments and identify which components have the biggest impact on the final grade.

**Challenges I faced:**
One challenge was structuring the gradebook so that it was both easy to use and formula-driven. Applying conditional logic to convert number grades into letter grades took some trial and error. I also had to ensure that the weightings added up to 100% and that each formula dynamically adjusted based on input. These were resolved by testing the calculator with sample data and cross-checking results with grading rubrics in my syllabi.

**Other Resources:**
I used my course syllabi to get accurate assignment weights and grading scales. I also referenced Excel tutorials—especially for IF statements, percentage calculations, and chart creation. While I didn’t collaborate with others directly, I reviewed examples of grade calculators online to get formatting ideas.

**Result:**
I set out to build a personalized, flexible grade calculator for two of my classes, and I achieved that goal. The calculator includes live formulas that compute my current grade, predict my final outcome, and display my progress in both number and letter format. The pie chart helps me visually prioritize high-impact assignments. If I were to take this further, I’d add a third class or build a dashboard that compares overall GPA projections.
