### About Me 
Hi! I am a psychology and statistics scholar with over 3 years of proven expertise in child care.

With skills in time management, flexibility, communication, and conflict resolution, I am able to design and implement developmentally appropriate, evidence-based strategies for supporting childrenâ€™s growth, and achieve measurable improvements in emotional regulation and social skills. I am also adept at using Excel, SPSS, and Python to collect, analyze, and interpret behavioral data in both academic and applied settings.

My comprehensive skill set, commitment to encountering all people with empathy, and passion for accessible and de-stigmatized mental health assistance makes me a valuable asset in both the psychology and child care fields. In my spare time, I like to hike, play soccer, hang out with friends and family, and go to the beach.
